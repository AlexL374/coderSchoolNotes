# CoderSchoolNotes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.2 with the purpose of generating notes for 
students at TheCoderSchool. This website is supposed to be a more clean looking version of Brandon Cortes's Note Generator (https://brandoncortes.xyz/tcsr/dev-fork/)
with the added functionality of making notes for Trial sessions with the students. I aimed to incorporate the light green theme into the
website as well as making all the inputs cleaner looking.
